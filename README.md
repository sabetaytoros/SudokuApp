Sudoku Solver

The solution for Sudoku Solving is Backtrace algorithm. 
Backtrace algorithm uses brut force. 
In order to enhance the performance of Sudoku solver Application before starting to use  backtrace algorithm,
the program tries to  fill  the obvious known digits. The program is organized with Digits, Cells, Boxes, Lines, Ribbons
and finally Posibility structures. Sudoku solver opens the Sudoku.txt file reads the 9 input sudoku lines that each contains
9 digits. If you want to try or test sudoku solver you have the add another puzzle to Sudoku.txt file. 

If the puzzle has more than 27 clues it does not need to backtree algorithm it solves directly the puzzle.

Now the challenge is to write the BackTrace Algorithm as a Generic Program to be used other than Sudoku games.
This will show my skills on Generic Programing.

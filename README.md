# SudokuApp

I made Aliyah to Israel in January 2016.
Since than I am not working.
I am searching for a C++ programing job in Israel.
I am engineer and C++ programmer.  
Although I sent my CV to several companies in Israel, 
either I"m old or my background education is not Computer Science, 
no one companydares to hire me. 
In engineering a sketch is worth to thousand lines of explanation.   
Rather  telling what did I do in the past, I prefer to show you what can I do now.
In order to facilitate the human resources's job,
I decide to write an application software using C++ to show my skills
what am I capable to do, how do I solve, design and organize a problem.
The following Application is written with Modern C++, using MinGW compiler and Netbeans IDE.  


Sudoku Solver

The solution for Sudoku Solving is Backtrace algorithm. 
Backtrace algorithm uses brut force. 
In order to enhance the performance of Sudoku solver Application before starting to use  backtrace algorithm,
the program tries to  fill  the obvious known digits. The program is organized with Digits, Cells, Boxes, Lines, Ribbons
and finally Posibility structures. Sudoku solver opens the Sudoku.txt file reads the 9 input sudoku lines that each contains
9 digits. If you want to try or test sudoku solver you have the add another puzzle to Sudoku.txt file. 

If the puzzle has more than 27 clues it does not need to backtree algorithm it solves directly the puzzle.
